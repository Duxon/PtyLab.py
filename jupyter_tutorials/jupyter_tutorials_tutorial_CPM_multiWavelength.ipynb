    "# multiWavelength ptychography\n",
    " - This tutorial shows a reconstruction with a multiwavelength dataset measusred with a mouse brain sample, which is used in the publication: \"L. Loetgering, X. Liu, A. C. C. De Beurs, M. Du, G. Kuijper, K. S. E. Eikema, and S. Witte, “Tailoring spatial entropy in extreme ultraviolet focused beams for multispectral ptychography,” Optica 8, 130 (2021)\".\n",
    " - Download the dataset from figshare: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Brain_smoothBeam_poly_bin8_hdf5/19107068\n",
    " - A kind suggestion: check out general tutorials for CPM (conventional ptychographic microscopy) before diving into this one."
